The film's bittersweet story is a charming romantic-comedy, a kind of Cinderella tale in reverse (with an April-October romance). A runaway princess (Hepburn) rebels against her royal obligations and escapes the insulated confines of her royal prison to find a 'Prince Charming' commoner - an American reporter (Peck) covering the royal tour in Rome. The story was reportedly based on the real-life Italian adventures of British Princess Margaret.

> I have to leave you now.  
I'm going to that corner there and turning.  
You stay in the car and drive away.  
Promise not to watch me go beyond the corner.  
Just drive away and leave me.  
As I leave you.
